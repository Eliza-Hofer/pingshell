# pingshell
 the plan fo rthis is to use a combo of tcp dumping to a file that is then parsed and grepped for the input from the c2 CLUSTER I will use different numbers of pings from different addresses to communicate with the victim. The C2 will send and recieve pings and have its own encoding and parser.  I dont inend to use this for malicious purpouses just a fun summer project
 
work in progress. a shell/malware that only communicates via ping smuggling
