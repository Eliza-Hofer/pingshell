# pingshell
 the plan fo rthis is to use a combo of tcp dumping to a file that is then parsed and grepped for the input from the c2 CLUSTER I will use different numbers of pings from different addresses to communicate with the victim. The C2 will send and recieve pings and have its own encoding and parser.  I dont inend to use this for malicious purpouses just a fun summer project
 
work in progress. a shell/malware that only communicates via ping smuggling
the idea is to listen on the victim device for pings from specific addresses predetermined and hard coded. This shell would be noisy and easy to track and impractical, but it would be interesting to see how many computers could be comprimised through falling victim to ping smuggling. There is also a way to obfuscate origin addresses as long as you have other addresses or a botnet pinging regularly for "noise"
